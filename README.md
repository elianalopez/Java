GitHub repository for CS 330 Programming Language Project (PLP) which will mainly consist of Java Tutorials

## Assignment 1: Language Selection and Overview
This assignment consist of researching my language of choice, Java, and I answer questions based on the language's history, functionaility, and how it is utilized.

## Assignment 2: Installation, programming environment, and Hello, World!
### Installing Java for Windows
For assignment 2 I have documented a tutorial on how to install Java for windows. If you would like to read it, link to the PDF is <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment2/Java_Installation.pdf">here</a>.
### Hello, World! Program and Documentation
I have also created a Hello, World! program in Java under the name <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment2/hello.java">hello.java</a>.
Lastly, all my documentation regarding installation, programming environment, and the Hello, World! programming processes has been documented to this <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment2/PLP-Assignment2.pdf">PDF</a>.
## Assignment 3: Data types and naming conventions
In this assignmentI have studied the various types of primitive and non-primitive data types in Java. I have also learned about the best naming convetions for Java when it comes to naming certain variables in order to make Java legible and easy to analyze from a causal spectator of my code. This entire assigment has been recorded <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment3/PLP-Assignment3.pdf">here</a>.
Down below is a short summary of the full-indepth information I have written.
### The primitive and non-primitive data types
Java has two categories of data types: primitve and non-primitive data types. Primitive data types are already pre-defined data types while non-primitve data types are created by programmer. 
#### Primitive data types
* Byte                
* Short               
* Int                 
* Long
* Float
* Double
* Boolean
* Char

#### Non-Primitive data types
* Strings               
* Arrays             
* Classes
