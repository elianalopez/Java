    <p align="center">This GitHub repository is created for a semester long project in my CS 330 (Structure and Organization of Programming Language) class. I have chosen Java as the language of my choice, so throughout this repository you will view Java tutorials, Java specific structures(syntax, naming conventions, ect...), and general computer science foundations that can be applied with Java.</p>

## Assignment 1: Language Selection and Overview
This assignment consist of researching my language of choice, Java, and I answer questions based on the language's history, functionaility, and how it is utilized.
The link to the document is <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment1/PLP-Assignment1.pdf">here</a>.


## Assignment 2: Installation, programming environment, and Hello, World!
### Installing Java for Windows
For assignment 2 I have documented a tutorial on how to install Java for windows. If you would like to read it, link to the PDF is <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment2/Java_Installation.pdf">here</a>.
### Hello, World! Program and Documentation
I have also created a Hello, World! program in Java under the name <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment2/hello.java">hello.java</a>.
Lastly, all my documentation regarding installation, programming environment, and the Hello, World! programming processes has been documented to this <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment2/PLP-Assignment2.pdf">PDF</a>.
## Assignment 3: Data types and naming conventions
In this assignmentI have studied the various types of primitive and non-primitive data types in Java. I have also learned about the best naming convetions for Java when it comes to naming certain variables in order to make Java legible and easy to analyze from a causal spectator of my code. This entire assigment has been recorded <a href="https://github.com/elianalopez/Java/blob/master/Assignment3/PLP-Assignment3.pdf">here</a>.
Down below is a short summary of the full-indepth information I have written.
### The primitive and non-primitive data types
Java has two categories of data types: primitve and non-primitive data types. Primitive data types are already pre-defined data types while non-primitve data types are created by programmer. 
#### Primitive data types
* Byte                
* Short               
* Int                 
* Long
* Float
* Double
* Boolean
* Char

#### Non-Primitive data types
* Strings               
* Arrays             
* Classes

### Java Naming Conventions
The practice of following these naming conventions make Java programs much easier to analyze and read for a casual observer of the code. Java communities, such as Sun Microsystems and Netscape, ecourage certain pratices utilizing CamelCase when naming variables. CamelCase is the practice of writing words without spaces or punctuation of any kind. 

```CamelCase```
```lowerCamelCase```
```UpperCamelCase```
To learn more about naming conventions, I recommended viewing the document Sun Microsystems created which I will direct to via <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html">this webpage</a>.
